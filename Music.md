# Music
### No matter what way I'm feeling, I always listen to music to feel more deeply in tune with however I'm feeling that day.

I have playlists dedicated to all sorts of different things. For example, when I'm showering or swimming I listen to songs like Zora's Domain from Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Below I listed each song example corresponding to what I'm doing while listening to music.
