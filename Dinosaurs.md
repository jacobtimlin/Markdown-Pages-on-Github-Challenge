## Mosasaurs are the coolest non-dinosaur

I really like dinosaurs. I like them so much that I decided to take a class about them this semester. My favorite non-dinosaur has to be Mosasaur, which is a giant underwater sea serpent looking one.

Mosasaurs are estimated to be around 60 feet long, which is longer than some school buses. I've always thought it's crazy to think that a giant sea monster that big once swam around in the ocean.

If Mosasaurs were still around today, I think that a lot of people would be extremely terrified of going in the ocean. I'm relatively scared of sharks, but I know that sharks only attack you if they're hungry or if you bother them. Mosasaurs, however, I feel like would just tear anything they see apart in order to get bigger. 

Mosasaurs lived along dinosaurs during the Late Cretaceous period.

## Dinosaur dinosaurs

My favorite actual dinosaur has to be the Spinosaur. Similar to the Mosasaur, the Spinosaur spent a lot of its time underwater. I think a recurring theme with me is that I really like the ocean and water, so it only makes sense that my favorite stuff is from the water as well.
