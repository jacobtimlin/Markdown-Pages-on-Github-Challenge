### Video Games are my childhood. Playing them makes me feel at home.

A lot of my spare time outside of school and work is spent on playing video games. The main reason that I play video games is to hear the cool soundtracks and explore beautiful open worlds. I really like playing MMORPGs specifically because it's very satisfying to have a character get strong over time, and it feels like your time isn't wasted completely since you are building up a character.

#### Roguelikes

Another game category I really enjoy are roguelikes. Risk of Rain 2 is one of my favorite games of all time due to the highly addicting gameplay coupled with the insane soundtracks the game has to offer. Sometimes when I take my headset off after a long run I'm surprised because I don't hear the epic music blaring in my house, and it makes me realize how immersed I was in the game.

#### MMORPG

Whenever I want to chill out and play a game that doesn't require too much effort, I go to the old classic Maplestory. I played this game a ton growing up, and recently picked it up a couple years ago and now have around 6,000 hours in the game. Anytime I'm bored I usually just login and start grinding my time away to the nostalgiac soundtracks the game has to offer.

#### Favorite of all time

My favorite video game of all time is Terraria. Terraria is so fun to me because every run you play is different, however it's more of a survival game than something like a roguelike. You could find an enchanted sword shrine in one world and play through with that a good portion of the early game, and then in a different world find a boomerang and have to adapt to what you get. I think that games like Terraria actually teach you a lot without you actually realizing.
